# DOM Manipulation Practice üöÄ

This repository contains various practice examples related to **DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation** using vanilla JavaScript.

The goal of this repo is to improve my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements, events, and browser rendering. I will be adding more exercises regularly as I continue learning and exploring new techniques.

---

## üß† Topics Covered So Far

- Selecting elements using `getElementById`, `querySelector`, `getElementsByClassName`, etc.
- Changing element styles and content dynamically
- Adding and removing elements from the DOM
- Handling user inputs and form submissions
- Event handling (`click`, `mouseover`, `submit`, etc.)
- Creating and appending new DOM nodes
- Changing classes dynamically
- Form validation and display logic
- Clock with time-based greeting
- Mini DOM-based projects like:
  - Counter
  - To-Do List
  - Calculator
  - Light/Dark Mode Toggle

and more continue....


‚úÖ Upcoming Goals
Build more interactive components using DOM APIs

Work with forms, modals, and tabs

Explore more advanced event handling (event delegation, bubbling)

Add animations and transitions using JS + CSS

Convert some logic to reusable functions

üíª How to Run
Just clone the repo and open the HTML files directly in your browser.

git clone : https://github.com/your-username/dom-practice.git

cd dom-practice

üå± Why This Repo?

This is part of my personal #100DaysOfCode journey to sharpen JavaScript skills. DOM manipulation is a key foundation for working with real-world projects like portfolio sites, admin dashboards, and more.
